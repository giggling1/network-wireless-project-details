Abstract : HetNet systems ICIC Management. Comparison of strict FFR , soft FFR , FFR 3 and Optimal Static FFR Schemes.

ICIC Management in HetNets and FFR:

Strict FFR Scheme : 
1. Frequency reuse factor (FRF) : 1 for Central Region
2. FRF : N for cell - edge regions.
3. Number of sub-bands : N + 1
4. No inter-cell co-tier interference
5. Important design parameter here is : centre-zone cell radius = 0.65 * Radius of the macro cell for which the throughput is maximized.
6. The parameter R-center is obtained using Monte-Carle simulations shown in

    Proc. of IEEE Globecom 2010 , pp. 1–5, 6-10 Dec. 2010

7. Sub band allocation for center is K-center = [ K-band * ( R-center / R )^2 ]
8. Sub band allocation for edge cell is K-edge = [ ( K-band - K-center ) / N ]



Soft FFR Scheme :
1. It is similar to Strict FFR.
2. The center region of any cell is allowed to use sub-bands of cell-edge zone.
3. Total number of available sub-channels in a cell is divided into N sub-bands with each sub band alloted to cell-edge region.
4. Soft FFR is more bandwidth efficient than strict FFR.
5. Both center region and edge region UE's will experience interference.
6. A power control factor ( E ) is introduced for edge-zone UE to reduce inter cell interference.
7. If UE 'm' is located in center zone then transmit power on sub-channel 'k' is P-m|k and if the user is in cell-edge zone then E*P-m|k
8. Sub band allocation for edge-zone UE's are : K-edge = min( K-band/N , K-band - K-center )


FFR - 3 Scheme:
1. Coverage Area is divided into centre - zone and edge - zone including three sectors per each.
2.
